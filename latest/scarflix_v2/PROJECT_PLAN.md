## PATH 2 STAGE B PROTECTED PILOT RESULT

**Updated:** 2026-06-11T01:05:16.095Z
**Status:** ROLLED_BACK_PILOT_VERIFICATION_FAILED
**Decision:** Pilot runner created aliases but verification failed; rollback was performed.
**Raw Handoff URL:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r0cksteadyw00t/plex-logs/main/latest/scarflix_v2/GROK_HANDOFF_FOR_GROK.md

### Outcome
The dedicated protected Path 2 pilot migration runner was created, registered with the Orchestrator, and exercised against a 3-title additive pilot. The fresh baseline gate passed at 74/105 visible, meeting the minimum threshold of 74.

The pilot did **not** pass verification. The runner created the additive traditional-file aliases, then detected verification failure and performed automatic rollback. No publication, expansion, cleanup, deletion, folder move, source mutation, cache clear, or refresh was performed. PAUSE_PUBLICATION remained active through the Orchestrator safety state.

### Selected Pilot Titles

### Rollback Reasons
- WebDAV HEAD failed for scarflix_part-d8b22fb3f498688e
- WebDAV HEAD failed for scarflix_part-2eaab8df357724dc
- WebDAV HEAD failed for scarflix_part-8aa2235ef7c1e0f6

### Verification Assessment
The failure is not a content-migration success. It indicates that the additive alias mechanism is not yet safe to scale because the service-context/local-path/WebDAV verification path could not prove continuity for the pilot titles. The correct next action is to keep Path 2 migration paused, preserve the runner as a protected harness, and diagnose the verification layer before any additional pilot attempt.

### Recommendation
Do not scale Stage B. Next safe focus: diagnose why Orchestrator service-context verification reports legacy path ENOENT/WebDAV HEAD failures for titles that remain represented in webdav_map.json, using read-only checks only. If a future retry is considered, use one title only and require a preflight WebDAV HEAD PASS before creating any alias.

## PATH 2 STAGE B APPLY-FIX STATUS — MIGRATION HELD

**Updated UTC:** 2026-06-11T00:45:27.615Z
**Status:** STOPPED_BEFORE_PILOT_BASELINE_REGRESSED_AND_NO_PROTECTED_MIGRATION_RUNNER
**Raw handoff URL:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r0cksteadyw00t/plex-logs/main/latest/scarflix_v2/GROK_HANDOFF_FOR_GROK.md

### What changed
- Orchestrator staged dispatch fix was activated by service restart.
- /healthz returned HTTP 200/PASS.
- Fresh uncapped Section 5 baseline job updated correctly, proving the stale-artifact dispatch issue is fixed.

### Fresh baseline
- Stage A reference: 83/105 visible, 22 missing.
- Fresh locked baseline: 74/105 visible (70.5%), 31 missing.
- Delta: -9 visible, +9 missing.

### Decision
Pilot/full migration was not executed. The baseline regressed before any mutation, prior path-mechanics preflight timed out, and no protected pilot migration runner exists. Forcing live path or map changes from Codex inline would not meet rollback/proof requirements.

### Next required action
Build a dedicated protected Path 2 pilot migration runner, then retry only after two stable/improving fresh baselines or explicit approval to use the lower 74/105 baseline as the reference.
