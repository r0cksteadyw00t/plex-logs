## PATH 2 STAGE B -- 10-TITLE PILOT HELD BY SENTINEL GATE

**Updated UTC:** 2026-06-11T03:24:31.927Z
**Status:** `HELD_SENTINEL_ALERT_HIGH_NO_10TITLE_MUTATION`
**Raw Handoff URL:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r0cksteadyw00t/plex-logs/main/latest/scarflix_v2/GROK_HANDOFF_FOR_GROK.md

The requested 10-title additive pilot did not run. The fresh uncapped Section 5 baseline was stable at `88/105` visible, but Sentinel is `ALERT/HIGH` with `codex_action_required=true`, so the safety gate correctly blocked queue activation before any Path 2 mutation.

### Current Gate State
- PAUSE_PUBLICATION: `true`
- Orchestrator: `PASS`
- Sentinel: `ALERT/HIGH` updated `2026-06-11T03:20:02Z`
- Launch degraded: `false`; timeout_rate: `0`; avg_spawn_latency_ms: `0`
- Fresh baseline: `88/105` visible, `17` missing
- Runner readiness: max target cap is now `10`; no 10-title job was queued

### Recommendation
Do not retry the 10-title pilot until Sentinel clears to `PASS/LOW` or `REVIEW/MEDIUM`. If the Orchestrator `last_error` persists as `Unknown named parameter '@created_utc'`, treat that as the immediate control-plane fix before reattempting the pilot.

## PATH 2 STAGE B -- 3-TITLE ADDITIVE PILOT PASS

**Status:** `PASS_3TITLE_ADDITIVE_PILOT_COMPLETE_NO_REGRESSION`
**Raw Handoff URL:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r0cksteadyw00t/plex-logs/main/latest/scarflix_v2/GROK_HANDOFF_FOR_GROK.md

### Outcome
The prepared 3-title additive pilot completed successfully for Annabelle (2014), Armageddon (1998), and Battleship (2012). The runner created exactly three traditional alias symlinks, preserved all legacy ScarFLIX_part-* paths, added alias rows to `webdav_map.json`, and completed preflight + post-verification for all three titles.

### Verification
- Runner status: `PASS_PROTECTED_ADDITIVE_PILOT_COMPLETE`
- Runner preflight count: `3`
- Runner verification count: `3`
- Independent WebDAV retry: PASS for all 3 titles
- Plex Section 5 visibility for pilot hashes: PASS for all 3 titles
- Pre-pilot visible baseline: `87/105`
- Post-pilot visible baseline: `88/105` visible, `17` missing
- Pre-pilot visible hashes lost: `0`
- Non-pilot visible hashes lost: `0`
- Newly visible hashes: `1`
- Rollback performed: `false`
- Rollback source retained: `D:\PlexTools\Backups\path2_pilot_2026-06-11T030859315Z\webdav_map.json.bak`

### Safety
PAUSE_PUBLICATION remained active. No publication, expansion, cleanup, deletion, broad scan, or source mutation occurred. The migration remained strictly additive.

### Recommendation
Safe to consider a larger bounded pilot next, but not full visible-set migration yet. Suggested next step: 10-title additive pilot after one more fresh baseline and Sentinel PASS/LOW or REVIEW/MEDIUM.

## PATH 2 STAGE B -- SNAPSHOT DISPATCH FIXED + 3-TITLE PILOT PREPARED

**Updated UTC:** 2026-06-11T02:58:01.889Z
**Status:** `PASS_DISPATCH_FIXED_BASELINE_STABLE_3TITLE_PREPARED_NOT_QUEUED`
**Raw Handoff URL:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r0cksteadyw00t/plex-logs/main/latest/scarflix_v2/GROK_HANDOFF_FOR_GROK.md

### Dispatch Fix
`section5_uncapped_index_snapshot` is now registered in `JasonOS_Prime_Orchestrator.js` and the Orchestrator service was restarted successfully. The old `Unknown job type section5_uncapped_index_snapshot` failure is resolved. A pre-clear test job completed with an expected `HELD_SENTINEL_ALERT_HIGH` artifact; after Sentinel cleared, a queued snapshot job completed with `PASS_UNCAPPED_BASELINE_CAPTURED`.

### Current Gates
- Sentinel: `PASS/LOW` at 2026-06-11T02:55:03Z
- PAUSE_PUBLICATION: `true`
- Launch health degraded: `false`
- Fresh baseline: `87/105` visible, `18` missing (`82.9%`)
- Baseline comparison: stable/improving versus prior 84/105

### 3-Title Pilot Preparation
Prepared but not queued: Annabelle (2014), Armageddon (1998), Battleship (2012). The prepared request is stored separately at `D:/PlexTools/state/jasonos_prime/path2_pilot_migration_request.prepared_3title.json`; the active runner request was not overwritten and no 3-title pilot was executed.

### Recommendation
The next execution may run the prepared 3-title additive pilot only after a fresh snapshot remains >=87/105, Sentinel remains PASS/LOW or REVIEW/MEDIUM, launch health is not degraded, and PAUSE_PUBLICATION remains active.

## PATH 2 SINGLE-TITLE PILOT PASS -- SCALING HELD

**Updated UTC:** 2026-06-11T02:34:53.678Z
**Status:** `PASS_SINGLE_TITLE_ADDITIVE_PILOT_COMPLETE__POST_RUN_SENTINEL_ALERT_HOLD`
**Raw Handoff URL:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r0cksteadyw00t/plex-logs/main/latest/scarflix_v2/GROK_HANDOFF_FOR_GROK.md

### Outcome
The fixed Path2PilotMigrationRunner successfully completed the one-title additive pilot for **Annihilation (2018)** / `scarflix_part-d8b22fb3f498688e`. The new traditional alias symlink exists, `webdav_map.json` has one additive alias row while preserving the legacy row, Plex still sees the pilot hash in Section 5, and WebDAV HEAD returned HTTP 200.

### Verification Numbers
- Alias rows: `1`
- Legacy rows retained: `1`
- Alias readlink: `ScarFLIX_part-d8b22fb3f498688e\stream.mkv`
- WebDAV HEAD: `PASS HTTP 200 in 1311ms`
- Fresh Section 5 snapshot after pilot: `undefined/undefined` visible, `undefined` missing
- Pilot hash present in Plex snapshot: `true`
- Rollback performed: `false`
- PAUSE_PUBLICATION: `true`

### Hold / Blockers
- Sentinel returned to `ALERT/HIGH` after the pilot; no scaling is authorized while this remains true.
- `section5_uncapped_index_snapshot` is still not registered as an Orchestrator job type; the final read-only snapshot was run directly after the queue returned `Unknown job type`. This should be fixed before any larger pilot.

### Recommendation
Hold scaling while Sentinel is ALERT/HIGH. Fix/register the Orchestrator dispatch for section5_uncapped_index_snapshot, then run one quiet soak/recheck. If Sentinel is REVIEW/MEDIUM or PASS/LOW and the one-title alias remains stable, the next safe step is a 3-title additive pilot with the same verification model and rollback gate.

## PATH 2 VERIFICATION MODEL FIX + SINGLE-TITLE PILOT HELD

**Updated:** 2026-06-11T01:36:46.412Z
**Status:** HELD_SENTINEL_ALERT_AFTER_RUNNER_PATCH
**Raw Handoff URL:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r0cksteadyw00t/plex-logs/main/latest/scarflix_v2/GROK_HANDOFF_FOR_GROK.md

### Verification Model Updated
The protected Path2PilotMigrationRunner was patched to avoid LocalSystem dereference of S:-backed rclone symlinks. It now verifies service-context symlink objects/readlink metadata, runs WebDAV preflight with retry/backoff before mutation, and uses Plex baseline presence plus bounded WebDAV retry after alias creation.

### Single-Title Pilot Gate
A one-title pilot for Annihilation (scarflix_part-d8b22fb3f498688e) was queued, but Sentinel was ALERT/HIGH at execution time. The runner correctly stopped before mutation with HELD_SENTINEL_ALERT.

### Safety Result
No alias was created, no webdav_map alias row was added, PAUSE_PUBLICATION remained active, and no publication/expansion/cleanup/deletion/refresh/cache clear occurred.

### Assessment
The code change is complete, but the new verification model is not yet proven by a completed pilot because the safety gate held. Path 2 should remain paused until Sentinel clears, then the same one-title pilot can be retried. Do not scale beyond one title until that pilot passes.

## PATH 2 SERVICE CONTEXT VERIFICATION DIAGNOSTIC

**Updated:** 2026-06-11T01:20:23.262Z
**Status:** REVIEW_PATH2_VERIFICATION_STRATEGY_NEEDS_ADJUSTMENT
**Raw Handoff URL:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r0cksteadyw00t/plex-logs/main/latest/scarflix_v2/GROK_HANDOFF_FOR_GROK.md

### Diagnostic Result
Read-only diagnostic completed. The protected Path 2 pilot rollback remains intact; no new migration, alias creation, map edit, refresh, cache clear, publication, expansion, cleanup, deletion, folder move, or path mutation was performed.

### Root Cause
The Orchestrator service runs as LocalSystem, while the affected ScarFLIX_part directories are symlinks to S:\media\ScarFLIX_part-* targets. LocalSystem does not reliably dereference the user-session rclone S: mount, so service-context checks of final stream.mkv paths return ENOENT. The traditional aliases created during the pilot would have traversed the same ScarFLIX_part directory symlinks, so alias object creation alone could not prove media readability.

The WebDAV HEAD failures during the pilot are a separate verification weakness. The pilot HEAD checks used original /media/ScarFLIX_part-*/stream.mkv paths, not the new traditional aliases. A later bounded read-only recheck produced HTTP 200 for 2/3 titles and one timeout, so the WebDAV layer appears latency/source-sensitive rather than deterministically broken for all pilot paths.

### Evidence
- Launch health gate: 28ms, 22ms, 23ms; average 24ms; 0 timeouts.
- Sentinel: REVIEW / MEDIUM.
- Baseline remains: 74/105 visible.
- Pilot rollback status: ROLLED_BACK_PILOT_VERIFICATION_FAILED.
- Current bounded WebDAV recheck: Annihilation HTTP 200, Armageddon timeout, Battleship HTTP 200.

### Recommendation
Pause Path 2 mutation work. Path 2 is not disproven, but the verification design must be changed before another pilot. Next safe work is to patch the runner verification strategy only: service-context symlink/readlink checks, WebDAV preflight with retry/backoff before mutation, and user-context or Plex/API verification for dereferenced media/playability. If a future pilot is authorized, run one title only.

## PATH 2 STAGE B PROTECTED PILOT RESULT

**Updated:** 2026-06-11T01:05:16.095Z
**Status:** ROLLED_BACK_PILOT_VERIFICATION_FAILED
**Decision:** Pilot runner created aliases but verification failed; rollback was performed.
**Raw Handoff URL:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r0cksteadyw00t/plex-logs/main/latest/scarflix_v2/GROK_HANDOFF_FOR_GROK.md

### Outcome
The dedicated protected Path 2 pilot migration runner was created, registered with the Orchestrator, and exercised against a 3-title additive pilot. The fresh baseline gate passed at 74/105 visible, meeting the minimum threshold of 74.

The pilot did **not** pass verification. The runner created the additive traditional-file aliases, then detected verification failure and performed automatic rollback. No publication, expansion, cleanup, deletion, folder move, source mutation, cache clear, or refresh was performed. PAUSE_PUBLICATION remained active through the Orchestrator safety state.

### Selected Pilot Titles

### Rollback Reasons
- WebDAV HEAD failed for scarflix_part-d8b22fb3f498688e
- WebDAV HEAD failed for scarflix_part-2eaab8df357724dc
- WebDAV HEAD failed for scarflix_part-8aa2235ef7c1e0f6

- restored_webdav_map_backup: D:\PlexTools\state\scarflix_v2\webdav_map.json

### Verification Assessment
The failure is not a content-migration success. It indicates that the additive alias mechanism is not yet safe to scale because the service-context/local-path/WebDAV verification path could not prove continuity for the pilot titles. The correct next action is to keep Path 2 migration paused, preserve the runner as a protected harness, and diagnose the verification layer before any additional pilot attempt.

### Recommendation
Do not scale Stage B. Next safe focus: diagnose why Orchestrator service-context verification reports legacy path ENOENT/WebDAV HEAD failures for titles that remain represented in webdav_map.json, using read-only checks only. If a future retry is considered, use one title only and require a preflight WebDAV HEAD PASS before creating any alias.

**Status:** STOPPED_BEFORE_PILOT_BASELINE_REGRESSED_AND_NO_PROTECTED_MIGRATION_RUNNER
**Raw handoff URL:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r0cksteadyw00t/plex-logs/main/latest/scarflix_v2/GROK_HANDOFF_FOR_GROK.md

### What changed
- Orchestrator staged dispatch fix was activated by service restart.
- /healthz returned HTTP 200/PASS.
- Fresh uncapped Section 5 baseline job updated correctly, proving the stale-artifact dispatch issue is fixed.

### Fresh baseline
- Stage A reference: 83/105 visible, 22 missing.
- Fresh locked baseline: 74/105 visible (70.5%), 31 missing.
- Delta: -9 visible, +9 missing.

### Decision
Pilot/full migration was not executed. The baseline regressed before any mutation, prior path-mechanics preflight timed out, and no protected pilot migration runner exists. Forcing live path or map changes from Codex inline would not meet rollback/proof requirements.

### Next required action
Build a dedicated protected Path 2 pilot migration runner, then retry only after two stable/improving fresh baselines or explicit approval to use the lower 74/105 baseline as the reference.
