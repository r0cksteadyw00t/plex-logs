- Updated UTC: 2026-06-12T01:08:18.237Z
- Status: `PASS_UNCAPPED_BASELINE_CAPTURED`
- Read-only: true
- PAUSE_PUBLICATION active: true
- Plex Section 5 reported total size: 213
- Parsed Section 5 Video rows: 213
- Pages read: 1
- Unique indexed ScarFLIX_part hashes: 198
- Expected affected hashes present: 102/105 (97.1%)
- Expected affected hashes missing: 3

## Conclusion

The previous 16/105 result was at least partly a measurement artifact. The uncapped snapshot found 102/105 expected affected hashes currently present in Plex Section 5.

## Next Safe Action

Use this true baseline to perform a smaller read-only passing-vs-missing forensic diff: compare Plex indexed paths, source folder depth, scanner title, and Plex scanner logs for representative present and missing hashes. Do not refresh or mutate yet.
