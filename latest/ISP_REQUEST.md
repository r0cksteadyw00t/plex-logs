# ISP REQUEST — Public IPv4 / Inbound TCP 32400

**From:** customer at WAN $wan  
**Date (UTC):** 2025-10-09T12:37:19.5075900Z

Hello Support,

Please place my service on a **public (non-CGNAT) IPv4** or enable inbound **TCP 32400** to my WAN IP so I can host a small home media server (Plex).

### Technical details
- Router port forward is configured: **TCP 32400 → 192.168.1.184:32400**
- Current Remote Access status: **Relay** (Plex still using relays)
- Local health: **/identity 200 (4 ms)**, **/resources 200 (1 ms)**
- I understand inbound access may require a plan change or static/Public IP add-on; happy to accept any fees.

### Why
Plex Remote Access needs one inbound TCP port to reach my Plex server directly for secure streams to my devices.

Thanks!
